# Nullchan

Root repository for nullchan project.

Nulchan is an attempt to make a truly anonymous forum
that will not be tied to a specific owner.
The idea is very similar to Fediverse,
with the exception that the posts don't have authors.

We rely on IPFS to store and deliver content.
Perhabs in the future, the site itself will be delivered through IPFS.

## Repositories
- [Frontend](https://github.com/alt-web/null-ui) (Powered by Next.JS)
- [Backend](https://github.com/alt-web/null-backend) (Powered by Django Rest Framework)

## Our plans
- [x] Basic functionality for communication on one server.
- [ ] Maximize the use of IPFS for distributed content delivery from a single server.
- [ ] Make the site federated, implement synchronization between servers.
